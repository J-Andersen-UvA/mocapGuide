\section{Troubleshooting}
\textcolor{red}{The signcollect website is red but Unreal Engine is open?} Restart the Unreal Engine project, make sure to go over the software setup steps again.\\
\textcolor{red}{A device in the PineapplePipeline is unhealthy (red), what do I do?} Check the health message in the UI's log. If that gives clues investigate. If you cannot figure it out by the message, turn off the relevant terminal and open the relevant script again. In other words: did you try turning it off and on again?
